Create a repo in any one of the platform github/bitbucket etc 

1. Create a codemagic.yaml file at the root of the project.
2. Create worflows in the codemagic.yaml file.
3. Create a signing keystore refrence by using following command
4. Command : keytool -genkey -v -keystore codemagic.keystore -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias codemagic [This generates the keystore file]
5. If you encounter a warming [The JKS keystore uses a proprietary format. It is recommended to migrate to PKCS12 which is an industry standard format using "keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore codemagic_test.keystore -destkeystore codemagic_test.keystore -deststoretype pkcs12".] then execute the same command again to generate keystore.
6. Generated keystore must be uploaded on Codemagic portal in your repo settings you'll find "Code signing identities". [link to upload keystore file - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPpGTY6Sis0]
